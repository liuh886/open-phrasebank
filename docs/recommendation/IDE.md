# IDE Auto-Complete
## [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)

Using [various-complements-plugin](https://github.com/tadashi-aikawa/obsidian-various-complements-plugin) in Obsidian. This plugin allows you to [self-define the dictionary ('phrasebank')](https://tadashi-aikawa.github.io/docs-obsidian-various-complements-plugin/1.%20Features/Custom%20dictionary%20complement/) for auto-complement.

You can just save the [phrasebank](https://open-phrasebank.readthedocs.io/en/latest/phasebank.html) into the dictionary path, then you will get auto complete when you are typing in Obsidian.

If you are get used to tab completion in VSCode, you can set use TAB key to trigger the accept of auto-completion.

## Windows

[Text prediction / auto-complete is already built in to Windows. ](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/enable-text-suggestions-in-windows-0bf313ca-c992-4173-aa5f-8341d3953498#:~:text=In%20Windows%20Settings%2C%20select%20Devices,typing%20on%20a%20physical%20keyboard.) and [Microsoft Office](https://www.howtogeek.com/726539/how-to-use-text-predictions-in-microsoft-word/). A precise phrasebank can be used to improve the accuracy of the text prediction, however, Untill now, I have not seen any information about how to self-define a dictionary in Windows.

One possible way is add the phrasebank into the Windows spelling dictionary, which is located at: %AppData%\Microsoft\Spelling, but not sure if it works for spelling check or text prediction.
