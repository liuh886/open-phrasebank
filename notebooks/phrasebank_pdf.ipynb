It will then go on to …. \\nThe first section of this paper will examine …. \\nThis paper first gives a brief overview of the recent history of X. \\nMy thesis is composed of four themed chapters. \\nThe overall structure of the study takes the form of six chapters, including this introductory chapter. \\nChapter Two begins by laying out the theoretical dimensions of the research, and looks at how …. \\nThe third chapter is concerned with the methodology used for this study. \\nThe fourth section presents the findings of the research, focusing on the three key themes that …. \\nChapter 6 analyses the results of interviews and focus group discussions undertaken during …. \\nThe remaining part of the paper proceeds as follows: …. \\nThe final chapter draws upon the entire thesis, tying up the various theoretical and empirical strands \\nin order to …. \\n…. and includes a discussion of the implication of the findings to future research into this area. \\nFinally, the conclusion gives a brief summary and critique of the findings . \\nFinally, areas for further research are identified. \\n \\nExplaining Keywords (refer to Defining Terms) \\nThroughout this paper, the term X will refer to …. \\nThroughout this dissertation, the term X will be used to refer to …. \\nIn this article, the acronym/abbreviation XYZ will be used. \\nAccording to Smith (2002), X can be defined as follows: “….” \\nThe term X is a relatively new name for …., commonly referred to as …. \\nWhile a variety of definitions of the term X have been suggested, this paper will use the definition \\nfirst suggested by Smith (1968) who saw it as …. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n13 | P a g e  \\n \\nReferring to Literature \\n \\nOne of the distinguishing features of academic writing is that it is informed by what is already \\nknown, what work has been done before, and/or what ideas and models have already been \\ndeveloped. Thus, academic writers frequently make reference to external sources. In some cases, \\nwhere the individual author is important, the author’s name will be the main subject of the \\nsentence; in other cases, the source may only be mentioned in brackets ( …. ) or via a number \\nnotation system (e.g. footnotes and endnotes). The ‘author as subject’ style is less common in the \\nempirical disciplines (sciences) and more commonly used in the humanities. The verbs and verb \\nphrases typically used for referring to sources are listed below. Note that different referencing \\nsystems are used in different disciplines. In the examples given here, the Harvard in-text referencing \\nsystem has been used. \\n \\nThe literature review: it is the purpose of the literature review section of a paper or dissertation to \\nshow the reader, in a systematic way, what is already known about the research topic as a whole, \\nand to outline the key ideas and theories that help us to understand this. As well as being \\nsystematic, the review should be evaluative and critical of the studies or ideas which are relevant to \\nthe current work (refer to Being Critical). For example, you may think a particular study did not \\ninvestigate some important aspect of the area you are researching, that the authors failed to notice \\na weakness in their methods, or that their conclusion is not well-supported. \\n \\nA note on verb tenses: For general reference to the literature, the present perfect tense (have/has + \\nverb + ed) tends to be used. For reference to specific studies carried out in the past, the simple past \\ntense is most commonly used. This is always the case where a specific date or time in the past forms \\na part of the sentence. When referring to the words or ideas of writers, the present tense is often \\nused if the ideas are still relevant, even if the author is no longer alive. The examples given below \\nreflect these general patterns. \\n \\n \\nGeneral descriptions of the relevant literature \\nA large and growing body of literature has investigated …. \\nMore recent attention has focused on the provision of …. \\nMuch of the current literature on X pays particular attention to …. \\nOver the past decade most research in X has emphasized the use of …. \\nThere is a large volume of published studies describing the role of …. \\nIn recent years, there has been an increasing amount of literature on …. \\nThe generalisability of much published research on this issue is problematic. \\nDuring the past 30 years, much more information has become available on …. \\nA considerable amount of literature has been published on X.

When reporting qualitative results, the researcher will \\nhighlight and comment on the themes that emerge from the analysis. These comments will often be \\nillustrated with excerpts from the raw data. In text based studies, this may comprise quotations from \\nthe primary sources. In quantitative studies, the results section is likely to consist of tables and \\nfigures, and writers comment on the significant data shown in these. This often takes the form of the \\nlocation or summary statement, which identifies the table or figure and indicates its content, and a \\nhighlighting statement or statements, which point out and describe the relevant or significant data. \\nAll figures and tables should be numbered and given a title. \\n \\nMore elaborate commentary on the results is normally restricted to the Discussion section. In \\nresearch articles, however, authors may comment extensively on their results as they are presented, \\nand it is not uncommon for the Results section to be combined with the Discussion section under \\nthe heading: Results and Discussion. \\n \\n \\nReference to aim or method  \\nChanges in X and Y were compared using …. \\nSimple statistical analysis was used to …. \\nTo assess X, the Y questionnaire was used. \\nTo distinguish between these two possibilities, …. \\nT-tests were used to analyse the relationship between …. \\nIn order to assess Z, repeated-measures ANOVAs were used. \\nRegression analysis was used to predict the …. \\nThe average scores of X and Y were compared in order to …. \\nNine items on the questionnaire measured the extent to which …. \\nThe correlation between X and Y was tested. \\nThe first set of analyses examined the impact of …. \\nTo compare the scores three weeks after initial screening, a global ANOVA F-test was used. \\nA scatter diagram and a Pearson’s product moment correlation were used to determine the \\nrelationship between …. \\nTable 1 \\nFigure 1 \\nshows \\ncompares \\npresents \\nprovides \\nan overview of …. \\nthe experimental data on X. \\nthe summary statistics for …. \\nthe breakdown of X according to …. \\nthe results obtained from the preliminary analysis of X. \\nthe intercorrelations among the nine measures of X. \\n  \\nThe table below illustrates \\nThe pie chart above shows \\nsome of the main characteristics of the …. \\nthe breakdown of …. \\n  \\n \\n24 | P a g e  \\n \\nAs shown in Figure 1, \\nAs can be seen from the table (above), \\nIt can be seen from the data in Table 1 that \\nFrom the graph above we can see that \\nthe X group reported significantly more Y than the \\nother two groups. \\n  \\nThe results obtained from the preliminary analysis of X \\nThe results of the correlational analysis \\nThe themes identified in these responses \\nare shown \\ncan be compared \\nare presented \\nare set out \\nare summarised \\nin Table 1. \\nin Figure 1. \\n  \\nHighlighting significant data in a table or chart  \\nIt is apparent from this table that very few …. \\nThis table is quite revealing in several ways.

Discussion sections \\nin dissertations and research articles are probably the most complex sections in terms of their \\nelements. They normally centre around a 'statement of result' or an important 'finding'.

This usually involves a process of analysis, in which we \\ncompare the specific parts as well as the whole. Comparison may also be a preliminary stage of \\nevaluation. For example, by comparing specific aspects of A and B, we can decide which is more \\nuseful or valuable. Many paragraphs whose function is to compare or contrast will begin with an \\nintroductory sentence expressed in general terms.  \\n \\nIntroductory Sentences: Differences \\nX is different from Y in a number of respects. \\nX differs from Y in a number of important ways. \\nThere are a number of important differences between X and Y. \\nWomen and men differ not only in physical attributes but also in the way in which they …. \\nSmith (2003) \\nfound \\nobserved \\ndistinct \\nsignificant \\nnotable \\nconsiderable \\nmajor \\nonly slight \\ndifferences between X and Y. \\n  \\nJones (2013) found dramatic differences in the rate of decline of X between Y and Z. \\nAreas where significant differences have been found include X and Y. \\nThe nervous systems of X are significantly different from those of Y in several key features. \\n \\nIntroductory Sentences: Similarities \\nThe mode of processing \\nused by the right brain \\nis similar to that \\nis comparable to that \\nis comparable in complexity to that \\nused by the left brain. \\n  \\nThere are a number of similarities between X and Y. \\nThe effects of X on human health are similar to those of Y. \\nBoth X and Y generally take place in a ‘safe environment’. \\nNumerous studies have compared Xs in humans and animals and found that they are essentially \\nidentical. \\n \\nComparison within one sentence  \\nOral societies tend to be more \\nconcerned with the present \\nwhereas \\nwhile \\nliterate societies have a very definite \\nawareness of the past. \\n  \\nWhereas \\nWhile \\noral societies tend to be more \\nconcerned with the present, \\nliterate societies have a very definite \\nawareness of the past. \\n45 | P a g e  \\n \\n  \\n \\nIn contrast to oral communities, it is very difficult to get away from calendar time in literate \\nsocieties. \\nCompared with people in oral cultures, people in literate cultures organise their lives around clocks \\nand calendars. \\nThis interpretation \\ncontrasts with that \\ndiffers from that \\nis different from that \\nof Smith and Jones (2004) who argue that …. \\n  \\nComparison within one sentence (comparative forms) \\nWomen are faster/slower than men at certain precision manual tasks, such as ….. \\nWomen tend to perform better/worse than men on tests of perceptual speed. \\nFurther, men are more/less accurate in tests of target-directed motor skills. \\nWomen are more/less likely than men to suffer aphasia when the front part of the brain is damaged. \\nAdolescents are less likely to be put to sleep by alcohol than adults. \\nWomen tend to have greater/less verbal fluency than men. \\nIn the trial, women made fewer errors than men. \\nThe corpus callosum, a part of the brain connecting the two hemispheres, may be more/less \\nextensive in women. \\n \\nIndicating difference across two sentences  \\nIt is very difficult to get away from \\ncalendar time in literate societies. \\nBy contrast, \\nIn contrast, \\nOn the other \\nhand, \\nmany people in oral communities have \\nlittle idea of the calendar year of their \\nbirth. \\n  \\nIndicating similarity across two sentences  \\nYoung children learning their \\nfirst language need simplified \\ninput. \\nSimilarly, \\nLikewise, \\nIn the same way, \\nlow level adult L2 learners need graded \\ninput supplied in most cases by a \\nteacher. \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n46 | P a g e  \\n \\nDefining Terms \\nIn academic work students are often expected to give definitions of key words and phrases in order \\nto demonstrate to their tutors that they understand these terms clearly. Academic writers generally, \\nhowever, define terms so that their readers understand exactly what is meant when certain key \\nterms are used. When important words are not clearly understood misinterpretation may result. In \\nfact, many disagreements (academic, legal, diplomatic, personal) arise as a result of different \\ninterpretations of the same term. In academic writing, teachers and their students often have to \\nexplore these differing interpretations before moving on to study a topic.  \\n \\nIntroductory phrases: \\nIt is necessary here to clarify exactly what is meant by .... \\nThis shows a need to be explicit about exactly what is meant by the word X. \\nX is a term frequently used in the literature, but to date there is no consensus about .... \\nThere is a degree of uncertainty around the terminology in .... \\n \\nSimple three-part definitions \\nA university is \\nan institution \\nwhere knowledge is produced and passed on to others \\nSocial Economics \\nmay be defined as \\nthe branch of \\neconomics \\n[which is] concerned with the measurement causes and \\nconsequences of social problems. \\nResearch may be \\ndefined as  \\na systematic \\nprocess \\nwhich consists of three elements or components: (1) a \\nquestion, problem, or hypothesis, (2) data, and (3) \\nanalysis and interpretation of data. \\nBraille is  \\na system  \\nof touch reading and writing for blind people in which \\nraised dots on paper represent the letters of the \\nalphabet. \\n  \\nGeneral meanings or application of meanings \\nThe term X refers to …. \\nThe term X encompasses A), B), and C). \\nX can be defined as ….

At \\npostgraduate level, particularly in applied fields, students search out problems to study. In fact, one \\ncould say that problems are the raw material for a significant proportion of academic activity. \\nHowever, solutions cannot be suggested unless the problem is fully analysed, and this involves a \\nthorough understanding of the causes.

For this reason, they are often used in teaching. Finally, \\nstudents may be required to give examples in their work to demonstrate that they have understood \\na complex problem or concept.

A good recommendation is Practical English Usage by Michael Swan, Oxford \\nUniversity Press.  \\n57 | P a g e  \\n \\nThe present perfect tense may also be used to describe research or scholarly activity that has \\ntaken place recently  \\nSeveral studies have revealed that …. \\nPrevious studies of X have not dealt with …. \\nA considerable amount of literature has been published on X. \\nThere have been several investigations into the causes of illiteracy (Smith, 1985; Jones, 1987). \\nThe new material has been shown to enhance cooling properties (Smith, 1985, Jones, 1987). \\nInvasive plants have been identified as major contributing factors for the decline of ….. \\nThe relationship between a diet high in fats and poor health has been widely investigated (Smith, \\n1985, Jones, …. \\n \\nFor reference to single investigations or publications in the past the simple past tense is used \\nIn 1975, Smith et al. published a paper in which they described …. \\nIn 1990, Patel et al. demonstrated that replacement of H2O with heavy water led to …. \\nIn the 1950s, Gunnar Myrdal pointed to some of the ways in which ….

Evidence-based \\nPerhaps the most important distinguishing feature of written academic style is that it is evidence-\\nbased. Writers support their arguments and claims with evidence from the body of knowledge \\nrelevant to their discipline. In addition, any research that is undertaken, must make reference to \\nprevious work in the field. As a result, academic texts are rich in attributions to other writers and \\nreferences to previous research, as seen in the examples below: \\n \\n• \\nPrevious studies have shown that …. \\n \\n• \\nThese sources suggest that from the fifth century onwards …..  \\n \\n• \\nAccording to the 1957 Annual Medical report, the death of the 960 inhabitants of …..  \\n \\n• \\nHowever, as has been shown elsewhere (e.g. Smith, 1992), the increase in ….. \\n \\nFor further examples, refer to the section on Referring to the Literature in this document. \\n \\nIn addition, general propositions are usually supported with real examples. \\n \\n• \\nThis can be seen in the case of …. \\n \\n• \\nA good example of this can be found in …. \\n \\n2. Words of classical origin \\nUnlike everyday English, academic writing is characterised by a high frequency of words of classical \\norigin (Greek and Latin). The main reason for this is that Latin was the lingua academica during the \\nEuropean renaissance; in other words, it was the international language of scholars. Even up until \\nrelatively recently, great works of science, such as Isaac Newton’s Philosophiæ  Naturalis Principia \\nMathematica (1687), were written in Latin. Even where academic texts were written in English, \\nwords of classical origin were used for concepts and phenomena for which there was no equivalent \\nin English. \\n \\nAlthough the lingua academica of today is English, writers of academic English still tend to use words \\nwhich are derived from Latin, and also,  mainly through Latin, from Greek. \\n \\neveryday words \\n \\nacademic words \\nworry \\nstory \\nget rid of  \\na lot of  \\nnot enough \\ntrouble  \\nbig \\nway (of doing) \\nbring together \\nthing \\n \\n \\n \\n→ \\nconcern \\naccount \\neradicate  \\nconsiderable \\ninsufficient \\ndifficulty \\nsignificant \\nmethod \\nsynthesise \\nobject \\n \\n \\nThere are also some changes to grammatical words (though these are not of classical origin): \\n60 | P a g e  \\n \\n \\neveryday words \\n \\nacademic words \\nnot much research \\nnot many studies \\nisn’t any evidence \\n \\n→ \\nlittle research \\nfew studies \\nno evidence \\n \\n \\n3. Cautious \\nAcademic writers are careful about the claims they make: they take care not to appear certain \\nwhere some doubt may exist, and they are careful not to over-generalise. An example of this kind of \\ntransformation can be seen below. The second sentence is in academic style: \\n \\n• \\nDrinking alcohol causes breast cancer in women. → \\n \\n• \\nSome studies suggest that drinking alcohol increases the risk of breast cancer.  \\n \\nFor more examples of this kind of language, refer to the section on Being Cautious. \\n \\n4. Impersonal \\nIn the interests of objectivity, academic writers tend to remove themselves from the writing. The \\nfocus is on ‘what’ happened, ‘how’ it was done and ‘what’ was found. The ‘who’ (the writer) is not \\nnormally given very much attention. This is one of the reasons why personal pronouns (‘I’ and ‘we’) \\ntend not to be used.  In addition, academic texts rarely address the reader directly and the pronoun \\nnormally used for this, ‘you’, is avoided. \\n \\n• \\nYou could say that Churchill made some catastrophic decisions early in the War → \\n \\n• \\nIt can be said that Churchill made some catastrophic decisions early in the War \\n \\nThere are some exceptions: in certain disciplines, it may be appropriate for a writer to explain their \\npersonal interest in the research area. In some disciplines, the researcher may participate in the \\nresearch as a participant-observer. In these cases, ‘I’ will be used. The example below, which \\nillustrates the former situation, is taken from a dissertation in History. \\n \\nI became interested in X after reading …… I hope to convey some of my fascination for the \\nsubject, as well as expressing my admiration of the artistic achievements of those involved \\n \\nIn research undertaken by teams, for example in medicine and science, it is common for the \\nresearch to be reported using the personal pronoun ‘we’. \\n \\n 5. Nominalisation \\nThere is a tendency for academic writers to transform verbs (actions) into nouns. In the example \\nbelow, the verb ‘abandoned’ becomes the abstract noun ‘abandonment’. \\n \\n• \\nUnwanted Roman children were generally abandoned in a public place. → \\n \\n• \\nThe abandonment of unwanted Roman children generally occurred in a public place. \\n \\nAs a result of this kind of transformation, academic writing is characterised by long noun phrase \\nconstructions, as in:  ‘the abandonment of unwanted Roman children’.  In certain cases, these \\nnominalised forms can become long and complex:  \\n61 | P a g e  \\n \\n  \\n \\n• \\nthe effect of reducing aggressiveness by producing an ACTH-mediated condition of decreased \\nandrogen levels \\n \\nAlthough this kind of construction is considered normal in scientific writing, unless the reader is \\nfamiliar with the constructions, it does make reading difficult as there are so many pieces of \\ninformation to process in the one sentence. There is an argument that too much nominalisation \\nshould be discouraged. \\n \\n6. Rhetorical questions \\nQuestions to introduce significant new ideas are avoided, and are replaced with statements: \\n  \\n• \\nIs the welfare system good or not? → \\n \\n• \\nIt is important to consider the effectiveness of the British welfare system. \\n \\n7.  Contracted forms avoided \\nContracted forms (e.g. it’s, don’t, isn’t, aren’t) should not be used in academic writing. The only \\nexception would be if you re transcribing a recorded conversation or interview. \\n \\n \\n8. Precise and detailed \\nLast of all, one of the most noticeable features of academic writing is that it is very precise and \\ndetailed. This relates to the setting out and development of the thinking and the ideas as well as to \\nthe language used in the writing. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n62 | P a g e  \\n \\nA note on commonly confused words \\n \\nYour spell checker will only indicate words that are misspelt and which it does not recognise. \\nHowever, if a misspelling results in a word which has another meaning or use, the spellchecker will \\nnot show this to you. Here is a list of words which are commonly confused: \\n \\nAbbreviation/acronym \\nAn abbreviation is a shortened form of a word or phrase. Usually, but not always, it consists of a \\nletter or group of letters taken from the word or phrase. Dr. and Prof. are common examples. An \\nacronym is an abbreviation formed from the initial components in a phrase or a word. These \\nelements in turn form a new word: NATO, Benelux, UNESCO. \\n \\naffect/effect \\nAffect is a verb, e.g. A affects B;  \\nEffect is a noun and is therefore always used after an article/determiner (‘an’ or ‘the’/’this’), e.g. The \\nGreenhouse Effect. \\n \\ncompliment/complement \\nCompliment (verb) means to praise someone. Complement (verb) means to complete something in a \\nway that makes it very good. Both words can also be used as nouns. \\n \\ncomprise/consist \\nBoth words mean ‘to be made up of’, but only consist is accompanied by of.  \\n \\ndiscrete/discreet \\nDiscrete is an adjective which means ‘separate’ or ‘distinct’. Discreet is an adjective which means ‘to \\nkeep silent or tactful about something’. \\n \\nformerly/formally \\nFormerly means ‘earlier’. Formally means ‘conventionally’ or ‘officially’. \\n \\ni.e./e.g. \\ni.e. is the abbreviation for id est which mean ‘that is’ or ‘in other words’. \\ne.g. is the abbreviation for exempli gratia which has the same meaning as ‘for example’ and ‘for \\ninstance’. \\n \\nits/it's  \\nits – without an apostrophe - is a possessive determiner similar to 'my' or 'your' .  \\nit's is a contracted form of  'it is' or 'it has' . Note, however, that contracted forms are avoided in \\nacademic writing. \\n \\nlater/latter \\nLater is an adverb which means ‘at an advanced point of time’.  Latter is an adjective used to refer to \\nitems listed in a text. It means ‘most recently mentioned’; in other words, the last item. \\n \\npractice/practise \\nIn British English, practice is a noun and practise is a verb. American English allows both spellings for \\nboth forms. \\n  \\nprecede/proceed \\nPrecede means ‘to come before’. Proceed means ‘to go forward’ or ‘to begin to carry out’. \\n63 | P a g e  \\n \\nprinciple/principal \\nPrinciple is a noun which means ‘a basic belief, theory or rule’. Principal is an adjective which means \\n‘main’ or ‘most important’.  \\n \\nthere/their \\nThere is used to indicate the existence of something. Their  is used to indicate possession, i.e. if \\nsomething belongs to someone or something. \\n \\nprescribe/proscribe \\nPrescribe means to advise or authorise the use of something. Proscribe means to forbid or to restrict. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n64 | P a g e  \\n \\nA note on British and US spelling \\nThe most common difference which is noticed in academic writing concerns verbs which end in \\nise/yse Br. or ize/yze US: \\n• \\nanalyse Br.  v  analyze US. \\n• \\nindustrialise Br. v  industrialize US. \\n \\nThis difference also affects the nouns derived from the verbs: \\n• \\norganisation Br.  v  organization US. \\n• \\nglobalisation Br.  v  globalization US. \\n \\nAnother noticeable difference relates to words ending in re: \\n• \\ncentre Br. v  center US. \\n• \\nmetre Br. v   meter US. \\n \\nHere are some other differences: \\nBritish \\n \\nUS \\naeroplane \\nanalogue \\nbehaviour \\ncatalogue \\ncolour \\nconnection \\ndefence \\nendeavour \\nencyclopaedia \\nfibre \\nfoetus \\ninstalment \\nlabour \\npaediatric  \\nplough \\nprogramme \\nrigour \\nsceptical \\nskilful \\ntravelled \\n \\nairplane \\nanalog  \\nbehavior \\ncatalog \\ncolor \\nconnexion \\ndefense \\nendeavour \\nencyclopedia  \\nfiber \\nfetus \\ninstallment \\nlabor \\npediatric \\nplow \\nprogram \\nrigor \\nskeptical \\nskillful \\ntraveled \\n \\nIf you are writing for a British university or a  British journal, you  should use the British spelling. \\n \\n65 | P a g e  \\n \\nA note on punctuation \\nAs the purpose of punctuation is to make written English easier to read and to make the meaning \\nclear and unambiguous, good, accurate punctuation is important in academic writing.  The following \\nnotes highlight points of particular relevance to academic writing. \\n \\n1. Full stop  . \\n \\n• \\nTo indicate the end of a sentence \\n• \\nTo indicate an abbreviation such as etc., et al. (not always used) \\n• \\nTo indicate an omission in a quoted text [ ... ] \\n \\n2. Comma  , \\n \\n• \\nTo separate two main parts of a sentence  joined by words such as and, or, but,  \\n• \\nTo separate a dependent part of a sentence (beginning with words such as although, when, \\nbecause) from the main part, particularly if the dependent part comes first in the sentence \\n• \\nTo indicate additional information, however relevant it may be, in a sentence (parenthesis) \\n• \\nTo indicate a non-defining relative clause, which simply provides additional information, in a \\nsentence \\n• \\nTo separate items in a list such as clauses, phrases, nouns, adjectives, and adverbs \\n \\n3. Colon  : \\n \\n• \\nTo introduce an explanation: The reason the experiment failed was obvious: the equipment \\nwas faulty. \\n• \\nTo introduce a list, particularly a grammatically complex list: see the example below under \\nsemi-colon \\n• \\nTo introduce a direct quotation, particularly a long one: Jones (2003) states that: ‘     ’. \\n \\n4. Semi-colon  ; \\n \\n• \\nTo separate two sentences that are very closely connected in meaning (optional, in place of \\na full stop): Some students prefer to write essays; others prefer to give presentations. \\n• \\nTo separate clearly items in a grammatically complex list:  For Aristotle, motion is of four \\nkinds: (1) motion which ....; (2) motion which ....; (3) motion which ....; and (4) motion which.... \\n \\n5. Quotation marks  ‘    ’ / “    ” \\n \\n• \\nTo indicate a direct quotation \\n• \\nTo highlight words or phrases used in a special or unusual way: Quotation marks are also \\ncalled ‘inverted commas’. \\n \\nNB  Single quotation marks now seem to be more commonly used than double. For quotations \\nwithin quotations, use double quotation marks inside single (or single inside double). \\n \\n6. Dash  – \\n \\n• \\nGenerally avoid in formal academic writing.  Replace by colon, semi-colon, or brackets, as \\nappropriate. \\n \\n66 | P a g e  \\n \\nA note on article use \\n \\nArticles use in English is a very complex area. However, there are a few simple rules which will help \\nyou in many situations and these are explained below: \\n1. Singular countable nouns \\nAll singular countable nouns are always preceded by a small modifying word known in grammar as a \\ndeterminer, and this is often an article (a/an, the). Countable words which are common in academic \\nwriting and which cause problems for non-native speakers of English, include: system, model, \\nmethod, approach, group, problem, effect, level, investigation, sector, study, participant, condition, \\ncategory  \\nNote that even if these words are preceded by uncountable nouns or adjectives a determiner is still \\nneeded:  \\n• \\nthe greenhouse effect, the transport system, the control group \\n• \\na high level, a systematic approach, a rigorous study, an exploratory investigation \\n \\n2. Plural countable nouns \\nIf the writer is thinking about a specific group, then the definite article is normally used:   The books \\nin this collection were published in the 19th or early 20th century.  \\nOtherwise no article is used:  \\n• \\nLearners tend to remember new facts when they are contextualised.  \\n \\n3. Uncountable nouns \\nUncountable nouns are not normally accompanied by an article: \\n• \\nScience has been defined as a systematic approach to answering questions. \\n• \\nReliability is an important quality of any test. \\n \\nBut if they are post-modified by  of…..,  or  which … the definite article is normally used: \\n• \\nThe science of global warming is a complex and controversial area. \\n• \\nThe reliability of this instrument is poor. \\n• \\nChemistry is the science which addresses the composition and behaviour of matter. \\n \\n \\n67 | P a g e  \\n \\n \\n4. Names \\nNames and titles are not normally preceded by the definite article (the)  \\n• \\nManchester University, Manchester \\nBut this changes if the noun phrase contains a post-modifying structure (of ….) \\n• \\nThe University of Manchester;    The United States of America \\nor if they contain words like organisation, association or institute \\n• \\nThe World Health Organisation, The American Heart Association, The Royal Society. The SETI \\nInstitute  \\n \\nApart from these simple rules, the other thing you need to do is to check how noun phrases are used \\nin the texts that you read. Make a mental note of this as you read, or check back to the source text \\nwhen you are writing.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n68 | P a g e  \\n \\nA note on sentence structure  \\n \\n1. Simple sentences \\nIn written English, all sentences contain a Subject → Verb structure. The subject always precedes the \\nverb, except in questions where the order is reversed. \\nS \\nV \\n \\nAn electron \\nis \\nan elementary particle. \\n \\n \\nThe subject may be one word, but it is usually a group of words centred around a noun. The verb, \\nwhich can indicate an action, a state, or simply serve to link the subject to other information, may \\nalso consist of more than one word. Various other sentence elements may be placed before or after \\nthe Subject → Verb structure:  \\n \\n \\nS \\n         V \\n \\nBetween 1933 and 1945, \\nrestrictions \\nwere placed     \\n        on German academics. \\n \\n \\nIt is common for the subject to consist of many words: \\nS \\nV \\n \\nThe information on various types of \\nwasps and bees in the report \\nwas \\n useful to environmentalists who were \\nfighting the use of pesticides. \\n \\nSometimes, however, the subject and verb can just be one word each: \\nS \\nV \\n \\nIt \\nis \\nalmost certain that a lower speed limit will result in fewer injuries to pedestrians. \\n \\nThese simple sentences always end in a full stop. In academic writing, however, many sentences are \\nmore complicated than this simple pattern. \\n \\n \\n2. Complex sentences \\nMany sentences contain more than one Subject → Verb structure, but one of these parts (known \\ngrammatically as clauses) will convey the main meaning and will make sense by itself: \\nDependent part \\nMain part \\n                                      S                                   V    \\n              S                                       V  \\nAlthough  findings of recent research  have shown    X, \\n  no controlled studies    have been reported. \\n \\nThe main part of the sentence is also known as the independent part. \\n \\n69 | P a g e  \\n \\nThe main part of the sentence can also be placed before the dependent part. \\nMain part \\n          S                           V    \\n  Oral societies          tend to be         more concerned with the present  \\n \\nDependent part \\n                             S                           V  \\nwhereas       literate societies         have         a very definite awareness of the past. \\n \\nThe dependent part of complex sentence is usually preceded by a word or phrase such as: although, \\neven though, if, even if, when, because, as, since, whereas, while. \\n \\n3. Compound sentences \\nSome sentences may have two   Subject → Verb structures and both of these convey meaning that \\ncan make sense by itself; in other words, there are two main parts.  The two parts may be joined by \\nwords like and, or, but, so, or by using a semi-colon (;) . \\nS \\nV \\n \\nSupporters of the ‘Great Divide’ theory agree \\nthat something is lost as well as gained when \\npeople become literate,  \\n \\n \\nS \\nV \\n \\nbut \\nthey \\nconsider \\nit is worth losing some benefits in order to obtain many others. \\n \\n \\n4. Common problems relating to sentence structure \\nProblems occur in writing when dependent parts of sentences are written as complete sentences \\nwith a full stop: \\n• \\nWhereas literate societies have a very definite awareness of the past.   X \\n• \\nAlthough a number of studies have been undertaken.   X \\n \\nProblems also occur when two independent parts are written as one sentence without a joining \\nword. \\n \\n• \\nSupporters of the ‘Great Divide’ theory agree that something is lost as well as gained when                     \\npeople become literate, they consider it is worth losing some benefits in order to obtain many \\nothers. X \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n70 | P a g e  \\n \\nA note on paragraph structure  \\n \\nA pattern that can be identified in many well-written paragraphs is that of a controlling idea \\nfollowed by supporting information.  The controlling idea, sometimes referred to as the topic \\nsentence, introduces a new idea, topic, argument or piece of information into the main text. This is \\nthen either explained further or supported by subsequent sentences. This structure can be \\nrepresented schematically thus: \\n \\n \\n \\nTopic Sentence  \\n  \\n(new point, expressed in general terms) \\n \\n \\nSupporting Information which may include a combination of: \\n \\n• \\nan explanation or reason \\n• \\nreference to previous research  \\n• \\nexamples \\n• \\nquotations \\n \\n• \\nstatistics \\n• \\nspecific aspects or details \\n• \\na development in time \\n• \\nan effect or consequence \\n \\n \\nIt is important that the explanatory or supporting information in a paragraph should relate to the \\ntopic sentence. If new points or ideas are to be stated, then these should be treated in a separate \\nparagraph. It is also important that the explanatory or supporting information should not repeat the \\ngeneral ideas expressed in the topic sentence. \\n \\nAn example of the kind of paragraph structure suggested above is given below. Note the \\ndevelopment from the general idea to the more detailed information. Also note the thematic linking, \\nwhich is signalled by the words in bold, between the sentences. Each of these words and phrases \\nlinks back to an idea introduced in the previous sentence. Here, the sentences have been separated. \\n \\n \\nMany children become interested in competitive sport at early \\nages. \\n \\nEarly involvement (prior to maturity) in competitive sport \\noften exposes found individuals to types of stress that may \\naffect their growth, producing a disruption of the normal \\ngrowth pattern (Wang, 1978; Al Masry, 1998). \\n \\nAmong cyclists the most potentially serious of these disorders \\nis likely to be increased thoracic curvature. \\n \\nCycling alters the anatomical position of the spine (to a flexed \\nposition) particularly the thoracic spine, and exposes the \\nanterior portion of the vertebral column to higher compression \\n(Smith, 1998; Jones, 2002). \\n\""

Most academic writers,  however, appear to do one or more of the following in their introductions:    •  establish the context, background and/or importance of the topic  •  indicate an issue, problem, or controversy in the field of study   •  define the topic or key terms   •  state of the purpose of the essay/writing  •  provide an overview of the coverage and/or structure of the writing     Introductions to research articles and dissertations tend to be relatively short but quite complex.  Some of the more common moves include:    •  establishing the context, background and/or importance of the topic  •  giving a brief synopsis of the relevant literature   •  indicating a problem, controversy or a knowledge gap in the field of study   •  establishing the desirability of the research   •  listing the research questions or hypotheses   •  providing a synopsis of the research method(s)   •  explaining the significance or value of the study   •  defining certain key terms  •  providing an overview of the dissertation or report structure   •  explaining reasons for the writer's personal interest in the topic     Examples of phrases which are commonly employed to realise these functions are listed below.

Explaining Keywords (refer to Defining Terms)  Throughout this paper, the term X will refer to ….  Throughout this dissertation, the term X will be used to refer to ….  In this article, the acronym/abbreviation XYZ will be used.  According to Smith (2002), X can be defined as follows: “….”  The term X is a relatively new name for …., commonly referred to as ….  While a variety of definitions of the term X have been suggested, this paper will use the definition  first suggested by Smith (1968) who saw it as ….                              13 | P a g e     Referring to Literature    One of the distinguishing features of academic writing is that it is informed by what is already  known, what work has been done before, and/or what ideas and models have already been  developed. Thus, academic writers frequently make reference to external sources. In some cases,  where the individual author is important, the author’s name will be the main subject of the  sentence; in other cases, the source may only be mentioned in brackets ( …. ) or via a number  notation system (e.g. footnotes and endnotes). The ‘author as subject’ style is less common in the  empirical disciplines (sciences) and more commonly used in the humanities. The verbs and verb  phrases typically used for referring to sources are listed below. Note that different referencing  systems are used in different disciplines. In the examples given here, the Harvard in-text referencing  system has been used.    The literature review: it is the purpose of the literature review section of a paper or dissertation to  show the reader, in a systematic way, what is already known about the research topic as a whole,  and to outline the key ideas and theories that help us to understand this. As well as being  systematic, the review should be evaluative and critical of the studies or ideas which are relevant to  the current work (refer to Being Critical). For example, you may think a particular study did not  investigate some important aspect of the area you are researching, that the authors failed to notice  a weakness in their methods, or that their conclusion is not well-supported.    A note on verb tenses: For general reference to the literature, the present perfect tense (have/has +  verb + ed) tends to be used. For reference to specific studies carried out in the past, the simple past  tense is most commonly used. This is always the case where a specific date or time in the past forms  a part of the sentence. When referring to the words or ideas of writers, the present tense is often  used if the ideas are still relevant, even if the author is no longer alive. The examples given below  reflect these general patterns.      General descriptions of the relevant literature  A large and growing body of literature has investigated ….

The Methods section should be clear and detailed enough for another  experienced person to repeat the research and reproduce the results. Where the methods chosen  are new, unfamiliar or perhaps even controversial, or where the intended audience is from many  disciplines, the Methods section will tend to be much more extensive. Typical stretches of text found  in this section of a research article or dissertation along with examples of the kind of language used  for these are listed below. Note that for most of the functional categories in this section, the verbs  are written in the simple past tense.

Further data collection is required to determine exactly how X affects Y.  It was not possible to investigate the significant relationships of X and Y further because the sample  size was too small.                              23 | P a g e     Reporting Results    The standard approach to this section of a research article or dissertation is to present and describe  the results in a systematic and detailed way. When reporting qualitative results, the researcher will  highlight and comment on the themes that emerge from the analysis. These comments will often be  illustrated with excerpts from the raw data. In text based studies, this may comprise quotations from  the primary sources. In quantitative studies, the results section is likely to consist of tables and  figures, and writers comment on the significant data shown in these. This often takes the form of the  location or summary statement, which identifies the table or figure and indicates its content, and a  highlighting statement or statements, which point out and describe the relevant or significant data.  All figures and tables should be numbered and given a title.    More elaborate commentary on the results is normally restricted to the Discussion section. In  research articles, however, authors may comment extensively on their results as they are presented,  and it is not uncommon for the Results section to be combined with the Discussion section under  the heading: Results and Discussion.

Following the addition of X, a significant increase (P<0.05) in the Y was recorded.  With successive increases in intensity of the X, the Y moved further to ….    Reporting results from questionnaires and interviews  The response rate was 60% at six months and 56% at 12 months.  Of the study population, 90 subjects completed and returned the questionnaire.  Thirty-two individuals returned the questionnaires.  By the end of the survey period, data had been collected from 64 individuals, 23 of whom were ….

In academic writing, however, it usually  refers to two types of activity: a) considering both sides of an issue, or question before reaching a  conclusion; b) considering the results of research and the implications of these. Discussion sections  in dissertations and research articles are probably the most complex sections in terms of their  elements. They normally centre around a 'statement of result' or an important 'finding'. As there is  usually more than one result, discussion sections are often structured into a series of discussion  cycles. The most common elements in these cycles, and some of the language that is typically  associated with them, are listed below.    Note that when offering explanations and suggesting implications the language used is very  tentative or cautious (refer to the section entitled Expressing Caution).    Background information: reference to literature or to research aim/question  As mentioned in the literature review, ….  The third question in this research was ….  Prior studies that have noted the importance of ….  An initial objective of the project was to identify ….  Very little was found in the literature on the question of ….  This study set out with the aim of assessing the importance of X in ….  The first question in this study sought to determine ….  It was hypothesized that participants with a history of ….  The present study was designed to determine the effect of ….  A strong relationship between X and Y has been reported in the literature.  In reviewing the literature, no data was found on the association between X and Y.    Statements of result:  usually with reference to results section  The current study found that ….  The most interesting finding was that ….  In this study, Xs were found to cause ….  The results of this study show/indicate that ….  This experiment did not detect any evidence for ….  On the question of X, this study found that ….  The most important clinically relevant finding was ….  Another important finding was that ….  In the current study, comparing X with Y showed that the mean degree of ….  X provided the largest set of significant clusters of ….  It is interesting to note that in all seven cases of this study ….  The results of this study did not show that …/did not show any significant increase in ….    Unexpected outcome  Surprisingly, X was found to ….  What is surprising is that ….  One unanticipated finding was that ….  Surprisingly, no differences were found in ….  This finding was unexpected and suggests that ….  It is somewhat surprising that no X was noted in this condition ….  Contrary to expectations, this study did not find a significant difference between ….  However, the observed difference between X and Y in this study was not significant.  However, the ANOVA (one way) showed that these results were not statistically significant.  28 | P a g e     Reference to previous research: support  These findings further support the idea of ….  This finding confirms the association between ….  This study confirms that X is associated with ….  These results match those observed in earlier studies.  The results of this study will now be compared to the findings of previous work.  The findings of the current study are consistent with those of Smith and Jones (2001) who ….  These results are consistent with those of other studies and suggest that ….  This finding supports previous research into this brain area which links X and Y.  This finding corroborates the ideas of Smith and Jones (2008), who suggested that ….  This finding is in agreement with Smith’s (1999) findings which showed ….    It is encouraging to compare this figure with that found by Jones (1993) who found that ….  Increased activation in the X in this study corroborates these earlier findings.  The present findings seem to be consistent with other research which found ….  This also accords with our earlier observations, which showed that ….  These results agree with the findings of other studies, in which ….  In accordance with the present results, previous studies have demonstrated that ….  The findings observed in this study mirror those of the previous studies that have examined the  effect of ….  This study produced results which corroborate the findings of a great deal of the previous work in  this field.  There are similarities between the attitudes expressed by X in this study and those described by  (Smith, 1987, 1995) and Jones (1986).    Reference to previous research: contradict  However, the findings of the current study do not support the previous research.  This study has been unable to demonstrate that ….  However, this result has not previously been described.  In contrast to earlier findings, however, no evidence of X was detected.  These results differ from X’s 2003 estimate of Y, but they are broadly consistent with earlier ….  Although, these results differ from some published studies (Smith, 1992; Jones, 1996), they are  consistent with those of ….    Explanations for results  There are several possible explanations for this result.  A possible explanation for these results may be the lack of adequate ….  It is difficult to explain this result, but it might be related to ….  There are, however, other possible explanations.  These factors may explain the relatively good correlation between X and Y.  These differences can be explained in part by the proximity of X and Y.  Some authors have speculated that ….  A possible explanation for this might be that ….  Another possible explanation for this is that ….  This result may be explained by the fact that ….  It seems possible that these results are due to ….  This inconsistency may be due to ….  This discrepancy could be attributed to ….  This rather contradictory result may be due to ….  29 | P a g e     The observed increase in X could be attributed to ….  Since this difference has not been found elsewhere it is probably not due to ….  The observed correlation between X and Y might be explained in this way. ….  The reason for this is not clear but it may have something to do with ….  It may be that these students benefitted from ….  There are two likely causes for the differences between ….  The possible interference of X cannot be ruled out.    Advising cautious interpretation  These findings cannot be extrapolated to all patients.  These data must be interpreted with caution because ….  These results therefore need to be interpreted with caution.  It is important to bear in mind the possible bias in these responses.  However, with a small sample size, caution must be applied, as the findings might not be  transferable to ….  Although exclusion of X did not reduce the effect on X, these results should be interpreted with  caution.    Suggesting general hypotheses   The value of X suggests that a weak link may exist between ….  It is therefore likely that such connections exist between ….  It can thus be suggested that ….  It is possible to hypothesise that these conditions are less likely to occur in ….  It is possible/likely/probable therefore that ….  Hence, it could conceivably be hypothesised that ….  These findings suggest that ….  It may be the case therefore that these variations ….  In general, therefore, it seems that ….  It is possible, therefore, that ….  Therefore, X could be a major factor, if not the only one, causing ….  It can therefore be assumed that the ….  This finding, while preliminary, suggests that .…    Noting implications  This finding has important implications for developing ….  An implication of this is the possibility that ….  One of the issues that emerges from these findings is ….  Some of the issues emerging from this finding relate specifically to ….  This combination of findings provides some support for the conceptual premise that ….  These findings may help us to understand ….  These results provide further support for the hypothesis that ….    Commenting on findings  However, these results were not very encouraging.  These findings are rather disappointing.  The test was successful as it was able to identify students who ….  The present results are significant in at least major two respects.  These findings will doubtless be much scrutinized, but there are some immediately dependable  conclusions for ….  The results of this study do not explain the occurrence of these adverse events.    30 | P a g e       Suggestions for future work  Further work is required to establish this.  This is an important issue for future research.  Several questions remain unanswered at present.  There is abundant room for further progress in determining …  Further research should be done to investigate the ….  Research questions that could be asked include ….  Future studies on the current topic are therefore recommended.  A further study with more focus on X is therefore suggested.  Further studies, which take these variables into account, will need to be undertaken.  In future investigations, it might be possible to use a different X in which ….  In further research, the use of this data as X could be a means of ….  However, more research on this topic needs to be undertaken before the association between X and  Y is more clearly understood.                                                                          31 | P a g e     Writing Conclusions    Conclusions are shorter sections of academic texts which usually serve two functions. The first is to  summarise and bring together the main areas covered in the writing, which might be called ‘looking  back’; and the second is to give a final comment or judgement on this. The final comment may also  include making suggestions for improvement and speculating on future directions.    In dissertations and research papers, conclusions tend to be more complex and will also include  sections on significance of the findings and recommendations for future work. Conclusions may be  optional in research articles where consolidation of the study and general implications are covered  in the Discussion section. However, they are usually expected in dissertations and essays.    Restatement of aims   This paper has argued that ….   This study set out to determine ….

Thirdly, the study did not evaluate the use of ….  The generalisability of these results is subject to certain limitations. For instance, ….  The most important limitation lies in the fact that ….  The major limitation of this study is the low response rate.  A limitation of this study is that the numbers of patients and controls were relatively small.

This essentially  means questioning what you read and not necessarily agreeing with it just because the information  has been published. Being critical can also mean looking for reasons why we should not just accept  something as being correct or true. This can require you to identify problems with a writer’s  arguments or methods, or perhaps to refer to other people’s criticisms of these. Constructive  criticism goes beyond this by suggesting ways in which a piece of research or writing could be  improved.  ...... being against is not enough. We also need to develop habits of constructive thinking.

The main limitation of biosynthetic incorporation, however, is ….  However, this method of analysis has a number of limitations.  However, approaches of this kind carry with them various well known limitations.  Another problem with this approach is that it fails to take X into account.  Perhaps the most serious disadvantage of this method is that ….  Difficulties arise, however, when an attempt is made to implement the policy.  All the studies reviewed so far, however, suffer from the fact that ….  However, there are limits to how far the idea of/concept of X can be taken.

However, these results were based upon data from over 30 years ago and it is unclear if these  differences still persist.    Introducing general criticism  Non-government agencies are also very critical of the new policies.  The X theory has been vigorously challenged in recent years by a number of writers.  These claims have been strongly contested in recent years by a number of writers.  Smith’s meta-analysis has been subjected to considerable criticism.  The most important of these criticisms is that Smith failed to note that ….  Critics question the ability of poststructuralist theory to provide ….  More recent arguments against X have been summarised by Smith and Jones (1982):  Critics have also argued that not only do surveys provide an inaccurate measure of X, but the ….

Other authors (see Harbison, 2003; Kaplan, 2004) question the usefulness of such an approach.  Smith’s analysis has been criticised by a number of writers. Jones (1993), for example, points out  that ….                39 | P a g e     Being Cautious  One of the most noticeable stylistic aspects of academic communication is the tendency for writers  to avoid expressing absolute certainty, where there may be a small degree of uncertainty, and to  avoid making over-generalisations, where a small number of exceptions might exist. This means that  there are many instances where the epistemological strength (strength of knowledge) of a  statement or claim is mitigated (weakened) in some way. In the field of linguistics, devices for  lessening the strength of a statement or claim are known as hedging devices.     Analysis of research reports have shown that discussion sections tend to be particularly rich in  hedging devices, particularly where writers are offering explanations for findings.    Devices that distance the author from a proposition  It is believed that ….  It is thought that ….  It is a widely held view that ….  It has commonly been assumed that ….

However, with a small sample size, caution must be applied, as the findings might not be ….  These findings cannot be extrapolated to all patients.  Although exclusion of X did not …., these results should be interpreted with caution.  It is important to bear in mind the possible bias in these responses.                                                    42 | P a g e     Classifying and Listing    When we classify things, we group and name them on the basis of something that they have in  common. By doing this we can understand certain qualities and features which they shares as a  class. Classifying is also a way of understanding differences between things. In writing, classifying is  often used as a way of introducing a reader to a new topic. Along with writing definitions, the  function of classification may be used in the early part of an essay, or longer piece of writing. We list  things when we want to treat and present a series of items or different pieces of information  systematically. The order of a list may indicate rank importance.     General classifications  X may be divided into  three main  classes.  sub-groups.  categories.     X may be classified  on the basis of  according to  depending on  in terms of  Y  into Xi and Xii.     It has become commonplace to distinguish ‘passive’ from ‘active’ forms of X.  There are two main types of memory: declarative and non-declarative memory.  Associative learning can be categorised into classical and operant conditioning.  Bone is generally classified into two types: X bone, also known as …., and Y bone or ….  Systems theory distinguishes two different types of X, i.e. social and semantic Xs (Al-Masry 2013).

This usually involves a process of analysis, in which we  compare the specific parts as well as the whole. Comparison may also be a preliminary stage of  evaluation. For example, by comparing specific aspects of A and B, we can decide which is more  useful or valuable. Many paragraphs whose function is to compare or contrast will begin with an  introductory sentence expressed in general terms.     Introductory Sentences: Differences  X is different from Y in a number of respects.  X differs from Y in a number of important ways.  There are a number of important differences between X and Y.  Women and men differ not only in physical attributes but also in the way in which they ….  Smith (2003)  found  observed  distinct  significant  notable  considerable  major  only slight  differences between X and Y.     Jones (2013) found dramatic differences in the rate of decline of X between Y and Z.  Areas where significant differences have been found include X and Y.  The nervous systems of X are significantly different from those of Y in several key features.    Introductory Sentences: Similarities  The mode of processing  used by the right brain  is similar to that  is comparable to that  is comparable in complexity to that  used by the left brain.     There are a number of similarities between X and Y.  The effects of X on human health are similar to those of Y.  Both X and Y generally take place in a ‘safe environment’.  Numerous studies have compared Xs in humans and animals and found that they are essentially  identical.    Comparison within one sentence   Oral societies tend to be more  concerned with the present  whereas  while  literate societies have a very definite  awareness of the past.     Whereas  While  oral societies tend to be more  concerned with the present,  literate societies have a very definite  awareness of the past.  45 | P a g e          In contrast to oral communities, it is very difficult to get away from calendar time in literate  societies.  Compared with people in oral cultures, people in literate cultures organise their lives around clocks  and calendars.  This interpretation  contrasts with that  differs from that  is different from that  of Smith and Jones (2004) who argue that ….     Comparison within one sentence (comparative forms)  Women are faster/slower than men at certain precision manual tasks, such as …..  Women tend to perform better/worse than men on tests of perceptual speed.  Further, men are more/less accurate in tests of target-directed motor skills.  Women are more/less likely than men to suffer aphasia when the front part of the brain is damaged.  Adolescents are less likely to be put to sleep by alcohol than adults.  Women tend to have greater/less verbal fluency than men.  In the trial, women made fewer errors than men.  The corpus callosum, a part of the brain connecting the two hemispheres, may be more/less  extensive in women.    Indicating difference across two sentences   It is very difficult to get away from  calendar time in literate societies.  By contrast,  In contrast,  On the other  hand,  many people in oral communities have  little idea of the calendar year of their  birth.     Indicating similarity across two sentences   Young children learning their  first language need simplified  input.  Similarly,  Likewise,  In the same way,  low level adult L2 learners need graded  input supplied in most cases by a  teacher.               46 | P a g e     Defining Terms  In academic work students are often expected to give definitions of key words and phrases in order  to demonstrate to their tutors that they understand these terms clearly. Academic writers generally,  however, define terms so that their readers understand exactly what is meant when certain key  terms are used. When important words are not clearly understood misinterpretation may result. In  fact, many disagreements (academic, legal, diplomatic, personal) arise as a result of different  interpretations of the same term. In academic writing, teachers and their students often have to  explore these differing interpretations before moving on to study a topic.     Introductory phrases:  It is necessary here to clarify exactly what is meant by ....  This shows a need to be explicit about exactly what is meant by the word X.  X is a term frequently used in the literature, but to date there is no consensus about ....  There is a degree of uncertainty around the terminology in ....

A projection  is a prediction of future change. Trends and projections are usually illustrated using line graphs in  which the horizontal axis represents time. Some of the language commonly used for writing about  trends and projections is given below.

Many of the phrases given below also contain approximators such as:  nearly, approximately, over half, less than, just over.

At  postgraduate level, particularly in applied fields, students search out problems to study. In fact, one  could say that problems are the raw material for a significant proportion of academic activity.  However, solutions cannot be suggested unless the problem is fully analysed, and this involves a  thorough understanding of the causes. Some of the language that you may find useful for explaining  causes and effects is listed below.    Verbs indicating causality  Lack of protein  may cause  can lead to  can result in  mental disability.    Scurvy is a disease  caused by   resulting from   stemming from  lack of vitamin C.

Examples can also be used to help the reader or listener understand unfamiliar or difficult concepts,  and they tend to be easier to remember. For this reason, they are often used in teaching. Finally,  students may be required to give examples in their work to demonstrate that they have understood  a complex problem or concept. It is important to note that when statements are supported with  examples, the explicit language signalling this may not always be used.      Examples as the main information in a sentence   A  An  well-known  notable  classic  useful  important  example of X is …..     For example, the word ‘doctor’ used to mean a ‘learned man’.

So it is useful to think of a preview section as a 'road map' for the  reader. It must be accurate, but it must be easy to follow.    Writers are also expected to indicate to the reader when they are moving from one topic to another,  or from on section of text to another. These are known as transition statements and examples of  these, together with some previewing statements, are given below.

For centuries,  In the second half of the 19th century,  At the end of the nineteenth century,  church authorities placed restrictions on academics.     Following World War I,    In 1999,      Fleming actively searched for anti-bacterial agents.    Fleming was named one of the 100 Most Important People of the  century.     Time phrases associated with the use of the present perfect tense: past and present connected   To date, little evidence has been found associating X with Y.  Up to now, the research has tended to focus on X rather than on Y.  Since 1965, these four economies have doubled their share of world production and trade.  So far, three factors have been identified as being potentially important: X, Y, and Z.  Until recently, there has been little interest in X.  Recently, these questions have been addressed by researchers in many fields.  In recent years, researchers have investigated a variety of approaches to X but ….  More recently, literature has emerged that offers contradictory findings about ….  The past decade has seen the rapid development of X in many ….

Writing about the past in English is made difficult by the rather complex tense system. However,  the  phrases grouped below give an indication of the uses of the main tenses in academic writing. For a  comprehensive explanation of the uses of the various tenses you will need to consult a good English  grammar book. A good recommendation is Practical English Usage by Michael Swan, Oxford  University Press.   57 | P a g e     The present perfect tense may also be used to describe research or scholarly activity that has  taken place recently   Several studies have revealed that ….

Evidence-based  Perhaps the most important distinguishing feature of written academic style is that it is evidence- based. Writers support their arguments and claims with evidence from the body of knowledge  relevant to their discipline. In addition, any research that is undertaken, must make reference to  previous work in the field. As a result, academic texts are rich in attributions to other writers and  references to previous research, as seen in the examples below:    •  Previous studies have shown that ….    •  These sources suggest that from the fifth century onwards …..     •  According to the 1957 Annual Medical report, the death of the 960 inhabitants of …..     •  However, as has been shown elsewhere (e.g. Smith, 1992), the increase in …..    For further examples, refer to the section on Referring to the Literature in this document.    In addition, general propositions are usually supported with real examples.    •  This can be seen in the case of ….    •  A good example of this can be found in ….    2. Words of classical origin  Unlike everyday English, academic writing is characterised by a high frequency of words of classical  origin (Greek and Latin). The main reason for this is that Latin was the lingua academica during the  European renaissance; in other words, it was the international language of scholars. Even up until  relatively recently, great works of science, such as Isaac Newton’s Philosophiæ  Naturalis Principia  Mathematica (1687), were written in Latin. Even where academic texts were written in English,  words of classical origin were used for concepts and phenomena for which there was no equivalent  in English.    Although the lingua academica of today is English, writers of academic English still tend to use words  which are derived from Latin, and also,  mainly through Latin, from Greek.    everyday words    academic words  worry  story  get rid of   a lot of   not enough  trouble   big  way (of doing)  bring together  thing        →  concern  account  eradicate   considerable  insufficient  difficulty  significant  method  synthesise  object      There are also some changes to grammatical words (though these are not of classical origin):  60 | P a g e       everyday words    academic words  not much research  not many studies  isn’t any evidence    →  little research  few studies  no evidence      3. Cautious  Academic writers are careful about the claims they make: they take care not to appear certain  where some doubt may exist, and they are careful not to over-generalise. An example of this kind of  transformation can be seen below. The second sentence is in academic style:    •  Drinking alcohol causes breast cancer in women. →    •  Some studies suggest that drinking alcohol increases the risk of breast cancer.     For more examples of this kind of language, refer to the section on Being Cautious.    4. Impersonal  In the interests of objectivity, academic writers tend to remove themselves from the writing. The  focus is on ‘what’ happened, ‘how’ it was done and ‘what’ was found. The ‘who’ (the writer) is not  normally given very much attention. This is one of the reasons why personal pronouns (‘I’ and ‘we’)  tend not to be used.  In addition, academic texts rarely address the reader directly and the pronoun  normally used for this, ‘you’, is avoided.    •  You could say that Churchill made some catastrophic decisions early in the War →    •  It can be said that Churchill made some catastrophic decisions early in the War    There are some exceptions: in certain disciplines, it may be appropriate for a writer to explain their  personal interest in the research area. In some disciplines, the researcher may participate in the  research as a participant-observer. In these cases, ‘I’ will be used. The example below, which  illustrates the former situation, is taken from a dissertation in History.    I became interested in X after reading …… I hope to convey some of my fascination for the  subject, as well as expressing my admiration of the artistic achievements of those involved    In research undertaken by teams, for example in medicine and science, it is common for the  research to be reported using the personal pronoun ‘we’.     5. Nominalisation  There is a tendency for academic writers to transform verbs (actions) into nouns. In the example  below, the verb ‘abandoned’ becomes the abstract noun ‘abandonment’.    •  Unwanted Roman children were generally abandoned in a public place. →    •  The abandonment of unwanted Roman children generally occurred in a public place.    As a result of this kind of transformation, academic writing is characterised by long noun phrase  constructions, as in:  ‘the abandonment of unwanted Roman children’.  In certain cases, these  nominalised forms can become long and complex:   61 | P a g e          •  the effect of reducing aggressiveness by producing an ACTH-mediated condition of decreased  androgen levels    Although this kind of construction is considered normal in scientific writing, unless the reader is  familiar with the constructions, it does make reading difficult as there are so many pieces of  information to process in the one sentence. There is an argument that too much nominalisation  should be discouraged.    6. Rhetorical questions  Questions to introduce significant new ideas are avoided, and are replaced with statements:     •  Is the welfare system good or not? →    •  It is important to consider the effectiveness of the British welfare system.    7.  Contracted forms avoided  Contracted forms (e.g. it’s, don’t, isn’t, aren’t) should not be used in academic writing. The only  exception would be if you re transcribing a recorded conversation or interview.      8. Precise and detailed  Last of all, one of the most noticeable features of academic writing is that it is very precise and  detailed. This relates to the setting out and development of the thinking and the ideas as well as to  the language used in the writing.                                62 | P a g e     A note on commonly confused words    Your spell checker will only indicate words that are misspelt and which it does not recognise.  However, if a misspelling results in a word which has another meaning or use, the spellchecker will  not show this to you. Here is a list of words which are commonly confused:    Abbreviation/acronym  An abbreviation is a shortened form of a word or phrase. Usually, but not always, it consists of a  letter or group of letters taken from the word or phrase. Dr. and Prof. are common examples. An  acronym is an abbreviation formed from the initial components in a phrase or a word. These  elements in turn form a new word: NATO, Benelux, UNESCO.    affect/effect  Affect is a verb, e.g. A affects B;   Effect is a noun and is therefore always used after an article/determiner (‘an’ or ‘the’/’this’), e.g. The  Greenhouse Effect.    compliment/complement  Compliment (verb) means to praise someone. Complement (verb) means to complete something in a  way that makes it very good. Both words can also be used as nouns.    comprise/consist  Both words mean ‘to be made up of’, but only consist is accompanied by of.     discrete/discreet  Discrete is an adjective which means ‘separate’ or ‘distinct’. Discreet is an adjective which means ‘to  keep silent or tactful about something’.    formerly/formally  Formerly means ‘earlier’. Formally means ‘conventionally’ or ‘officially’.    i.e./e.g.  i.e. is the abbreviation for id est which mean ‘that is’ or ‘in other words’.  e.g. is the abbreviation for exempli gratia which has the same meaning as ‘for example’ and ‘for  instance’.    its/it's   its – without an apostrophe - is a possessive determiner similar to 'my' or 'your' .   it's is a contracted form of  'it is' or 'it has' . Note, however, that contracted forms are avoided in  academic writing.    later/latter  Later is an adverb which means ‘at an advanced point of time’.  Latter is an adjective used to refer to  items listed in a text. It means ‘most recently mentioned’; in other words, the last item.    practice/practise  In British English, practice is a noun and practise is a verb. American English allows both spellings for  both forms.     precede/proceed  Precede means ‘to come before’. Proceed means ‘to go forward’ or ‘to begin to carry out’.  63 | P a g e     principle/principal  Principle is a noun which means ‘a basic belief, theory or rule’. Principal is an adjective which means  ‘main’ or ‘most important’.     there/their  There is used to indicate the existence of something. Their  is used to indicate possession, i.e. if  something belongs to someone or something.    prescribe/proscribe  Prescribe means to advise or authorise the use of something. Proscribe means to forbid or to restrict.                                                  64 | P a g e     A note on British and US spelling  The most common difference which is noticed in academic writing concerns verbs which end in  ise/yse Br. or ize/yze US:  •  analyse Br.  v  analyze US.  •  industrialise Br. v  industrialize US.    This difference also affects the nouns derived from the verbs:  •  organisation Br.  v  organization US.  •  globalisation Br.  v  globalization US.    Another noticeable difference relates to words ending in re:  •  centre Br. v  center US.  •  metre Br. v   meter US.    Here are some other differences:  British    US  aeroplane  analogue  behaviour  catalogue  colour  connection  defence  endeavour  encyclopaedia  fibre  foetus  instalment  labour  paediatric   plough  programme  rigour  sceptical  skilful  travelled    airplane  analog   behavior  catalog  color  connexion  defense  endeavour  encyclopedia   fiber  fetus  installment  labor  pediatric  plow  program  rigor  skeptical  skillful  traveled    If you are writing for a British university or a  British journal, you  should use the British spelling.    65 | P a g e     A note on punctuation  As the purpose of punctuation is to make written English easier to read and to make the meaning  clear and unambiguous, good, accurate punctuation is important in academic writing.  The following  notes highlight points of particular relevance to academic writing.    1. Full stop  .    •  To indicate the end of a sentence  •  To indicate an abbreviation such as etc., et al. (not always used)  •  To indicate an omission in a quoted text [ ... ]    2. Comma  ,    •  To separate two main parts of a sentence  joined by words such as and, or, but,   •  To separate a dependent part of a sentence (beginning with words such as although, when,  because) from the main part, particularly if the dependent part comes first in the sentence  •  To indicate additional information, however relevant it may be, in a sentence (parenthesis)  •  To indicate a non-defining relative clause, which simply provides additional information, in a  sentence  •  To separate items in a list such as clauses, phrases, nouns, adjectives, and adverbs    3. Colon  :    •  To introduce an explanation: The reason the experiment failed was obvious: the equipment  was faulty.  •  To introduce a list, particularly a grammatically complex list: see the example below under  semi-colon  •  To introduce a direct quotation, particularly a long one: Jones (2003) states that: ‘     ’.    4. Semi-colon  ;    •  To separate two sentences that are very closely connected in meaning (optional, in place of  a full stop): Some students prefer to write essays; others prefer to give presentations.  •  To separate clearly items in a grammatically complex list:  For Aristotle, motion is of four  kinds: (1) motion which ....; (2) motion which ....; (3) motion which ....; and (4) motion which....    5. Quotation marks  ‘    ’ / “    ”    •  To indicate a direct quotation  •  To highlight words or phrases used in a special or unusual way: Quotation marks are also  called ‘inverted commas’.    NB  Single quotation marks now seem to be more commonly used than double. For quotations  within quotations, use double quotation marks inside single (or single inside double).    6. Dash  –    •  Generally avoid in formal academic writing.  Replace by colon, semi-colon, or brackets, as  appropriate.    66 | P a g e     A note on article use    Articles use in English is a very complex area. However, there are a few simple rules which will help  you in many situations and these are explained below:  1. Singular countable nouns  All singular countable nouns are always preceded by a small modifying word known in grammar as a  determiner, and this is often an article (a/an, the). Countable words which are common in academic  writing and which cause problems for non-native speakers of English, include: system, model,  method, approach, group, problem, effect, level, investigation, sector, study, participant, condition,  category   Note that even if these words are preceded by uncountable nouns or adjectives a determiner is still  needed:   •  the greenhouse effect, the transport system, the control group  •  a high level, a systematic approach, a rigorous study, an exploratory investigation    2. Plural countable nouns  If the writer is thinking about a specific group, then the definite article is normally used:   The books  in this collection were published in the 19th or early 20th century.   Otherwise no article is used:   •  Learners tend to remember new facts when they are contextualised.     3. Uncountable nouns  Uncountable nouns are not normally accompanied by an article:  •  Science has been defined as a systematic approach to answering questions.  •  Reliability is an important quality of any test.    But if they are post-modified by  of…..,  or  which … the definite article is normally used:  •  The science of global warming is a complex and controversial area.  •  The reliability of this instrument is poor.  •  Chemistry is the science which addresses the composition and behaviour of matter.      67 | P a g e       4. Names  Names and titles are not normally preceded by the definite article (the)   •  Manchester University, Manchester  But this changes if the noun phrase contains a post-modifying structure (of ….)  •  The University of Manchester;    The United States of America  or if they contain words like organisation, association or institute  •  The World Health Organisation, The American Heart Association, The Royal Society. The SETI  Institute     Apart from these simple rules, the other thing you need to do is to check how noun phrases are used  in the texts that you read. Make a mental note of this as you read, or check back to the source text  when you are writing.                                   68 | P a g e     A note on sentence structure     1. Simple sentences  In written English, all sentences contain a Subject → Verb structure. The subject always precedes the  verb, except in questions where the order is reversed.  S  V    An electron  is  an elementary particle.      The subject may be one word, but it is usually a group of words centred around a noun. The verb,  which can indicate an action, a state, or simply serve to link the subject to other information, may  also consist of more than one word. Various other sentence elements may be placed before or after  the Subject → Verb structure:       S           V    Between 1933 and 1945,  restrictions  were placed              on German academics.      It is common for the subject to consist of many words:  S  V    The information on various types of  wasps and bees in the report  was   useful to environmentalists who were  fighting the use of pesticides.    Sometimes, however, the subject and verb can just be one word each:  S  V    It  is  almost certain that a lower speed limit will result in fewer injuries to pedestrians.    These simple sentences always end in a full stop. In academic writing, however, many sentences are  more complicated than this simple pattern.      2. Complex sentences  Many sentences contain more than one Subject → Verb structure, but one of these parts (known  grammatically as clauses) will convey the main meaning and will make sense by itself:  Dependent part  Main part                                        S                                   V                   S                                       V   Although  findings of recent research  have shown    X,    no controlled studies    have been reported.    The main part of the sentence is also known as the independent part.    69 | P a g e     The main part of the sentence can also be placed before the dependent part.  Main part            S                           V       Oral societies          tend to be         more concerned with the present     Dependent part                               S                           V   whereas       literate societies         have         a very definite awareness of the past.    The dependent part of complex sentence is usually preceded by a word or phrase such as: although,  even though, if, even if, when, because, as, since, whereas, while.    3. Compound sentences  Some sentences may have two   Subject → Verb structures and both of these convey meaning that  can make sense by itself; in other words, there are two main parts.  The two parts may be joined by  words like and, or, but, so, or by using a semi-colon (;) .  S  V    Supporters of the ‘Great Divide’ theory agree  that something is lost as well as gained when  people become literate,       S  V    but  they  consider  it is worth losing some benefits in order to obtain many others.      4. Common problems relating to sentence structure  Problems occur in writing when dependent parts of sentences are written as complete sentences  with a full stop:  •  Whereas literate societies have a very definite awareness of the past.   X  •  Although a number of studies have been undertaken.   X    Problems also occur when two independent parts are written as one sentence without a joining  word.    •  Supporters of the ‘Great Divide’ theory agree that something is lost as well as gained when                      people become literate, they consider it is worth losing some benefits in order to obtain many  others. X          70 | P a g e     A note on paragraph structure     A pattern that can be identified in many well-written paragraphs is that of a controlling idea  followed by supporting information.  The controlling idea, sometimes referred to as the topic  sentence, introduces a new idea, topic, argument or piece of information into the main text. This is  then either explained further or supported by subsequent sentences. This structure can be  represented schematically thus:        Topic Sentence      (new point, expressed in general terms)      Supporting Information which may include a combination of:    •  an explanation or reason  •  reference to previous research   •  examples  •  quotations    •  statistics  •  specific aspects or details  •  a development in time  •  an effect or consequence      It is important that the explanatory or supporting information in a paragraph should relate to the  topic sentence. If new points or ideas are to be stated, then these should be treated in a separate  paragraph. It is also important that the explanatory or supporting information should not repeat the  general ideas expressed in the topic sentence.    An example of the kind of paragraph structure suggested above is given below. Note the  development from the general idea to the more detailed information. Also note the thematic linking,  which is signalled by the words in bold, between the sentences. Each of these words and phrases  links back to an idea introduced in the previous sentence. Here, the sentences have been separated.      Many children become interested in competitive sport at early  ages.    Early involvement (prior to maturity) in competitive sport  often exposes found individuals to types of stress that may  affect their growth, producing a disruption of the normal  growth pattern (Wang, 1978; Al Masry, 1998).    Among cyclists the most potentially serious of these disorders  is likely to be increased thoracic curvature.    Cycling alters the anatomical position of the spine (to a flexed  position) particularly the thoracic spine, and exposes the  anterior portion of the vertebral column to higher compression  (Smith, 1998; Jones, 2002).\""
